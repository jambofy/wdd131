                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="images/myself.jpeg" alt="Nyasha Ushewokunze" class="portrait">
                <p>I'm Nyasha Ushewokunze, a technology entrepreneur passionate about solving business problems through innovative
                solutions. I'm currently pursuing a degree in software development and am especially interested in leveraging Python and
                Django to create impactful applications. As a co-founder of SocialHub, I'm involved in building platforms that integrate
                social media, websites, and customer relationship management.
                
                I'm also diving into agriculture and renewable energy. I'm starting a renewable energy company that will provide solar
                solutions and borehole services in Zimbabwe. One of my exciting projects is 'Quicker', a web app designed to make
                self-service processes smoother in supermarkets, banks, and government entities.
                
                In addition to my tech ventures, I'm a pianist and have served as a missionary in Ghana and Kenya. My faith plays a
                significant role in my life; I currently serve as a Stake Clerk. My ultimate goals include owning a software company,
                running an agribusiness, and earning degrees in both technology and agriculture.</p>

                <img src="images/zim-flag.jpeg" alt="Flag Zimbabwe" class="flag">
                <p>The Zimbabwe flag features seven horizontal stripes of green, gold, red, and black, symbolizing the nation's natural
                    resources, wealth, the blood shed during the struggle for independence, and the African heritage. On the left is a
                    whitetriangle with a red star and a Zimbabwe Bird, representing peace and the country's rich history. Adopted in 1980, it
                    reflects Zimbabwe's pride and resilience.</p>
